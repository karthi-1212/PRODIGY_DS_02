## Introduction
This repository showcases the code and analysis conducted during Task 2 of my Data Science internship at Prodigy Info Tech. The task involved meticulously conducting data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a selected dataset. Specifically, I opted to analyze the Titanic dataset sourced from Kaggle as part of this assignment.

## Dataset
The <a href = "https://github.com/kindo-tk/PRODIGY_DS_02/blob/main/Titanic-Dataset.csv">`Titanic_Dataset(Train)`</a> is a renowned dataset within the realm of data science, offering detailed information about passengers on the Titanic, encompassing their demographic details and survival outcomes. Widely acknowledged for its educational value, this dataset serves as a valuable resource for delving into diverse data analysis methodologies and techniques.
