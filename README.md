## PRODIGY_DS_02
The primary goal of this task was to clean up the data and analyze it to uncover insights from the Titanic dataset. This process included filling in missing values and investigating connections between different variables to detect any notable patterns and trends within the data.

## Introduction
This repository showcases the code and analysis conducted during Task 2 of my Data Science internship at Prodigy Info Tech. The task involved meticulously conducting data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a selected dataset. Specifically, I opted to analyze the Titanic dataset sourced from Kaggle as part of this assignment.

## Dataset
The <a href = "https://github.com/karthi-1212/PRODIGY_DS_02/blob/main/Titanic_Dataset(Train).csv">`Titanic_Dataset(Train)`</a> is a renowned dataset within the realm of data science, offering detailed information about passengers on the Titanic, encompassing their demographic details and survival outcomes. Widely acknowledged for its educational value, this dataset serves as a valuable resource for delving into diverse data analysis methodologies and techniques.

## Task Description
The primary goal of this task was to conduct meticulous data cleaning and comprehensive exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset to extract valuable insights. This process entailed addressing missing data points and scrutinizing inter-variable relationships to discern noteworthy patterns and trends within the dataset.

## Key Findings
- Conducted meticulous data cleaning procedures to address missing values and eliminate duplicate entries.
- Explored intricate relationships between variables such as gender, passenger class, age, fare, and survival rates.
- Identified significant patterns and trends within the dataset, including the higher survival rates observed among females, the impact of passenger class on survival outcomes, and the correlation between age and survival probabilities.

## Conclusion
The meticulous data cleaning and exploratory data analysis conducted on the Titanic dataset yielded valuable insights into the determinants of survival rates during the tragic Titanic disaster. This analysis enhances our comprehension of historical occurrences and exemplifies the utilization of data science methodologies to extract significant insights from complex datasets.
